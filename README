EDA.py
The EDA file takes in the December-2022-revised-110523-iii999.csv CSV.
Upon looking at the file it is clear that the vast majority (~98%) of Emergency admissions from A&E are from Type 1.
Additionally the majority of A&E attendances over 4hrs are from type 1. Given type one A&E visits are very different
from other visits it makes sense to consider them separately. As they are also the most important in terms of 
strain on the NHS I focused on Organisations with Type 1 attendances for this exercise.

Taking this set of organisations I create a few simple metrics of the performance of the organisation. These were the
propotion of people waiting over 4 hrs for admission. The proportion of people waiting over 12 hrs for admission
and proportion of Type 1 attendances over 4 hours. I saved out these performance metric to a new file that was 
used in the dash dashboard

dash_dashboard.py 
This dashboard plots these performance metrics for each organsiation with Type 1 admissions. We can see from
the dashboard that there is considerable variance between different departments performance.

There are several organisations that have 0 attendances over 4 hours and others that have 0 people waiting over
4 hours for admission. Given the data from other organisations these results seem suspicious and should be investigated
further to check the quality of the data.

The departments with people waiting over 12 hours for admission shows the largest range between organisations performance.
This looks like a good metric to identify organisations that are struggling.

Further graphs that would be helpful would be similar results and metrics grouped by trust to see if there are any trusts underperforming.
